\begin{abstract}
We investigated bicycle crash risk on Berlin’s urban street network, addressing a key limitation of many safety analyses: raw crash counts conflate danger with demand 
and thus fail to distinguish intrinsically risky locations from high-use roads. We combined police-recorded crashes from the German \emph{Unfallatlas} with a city-wide 
dataset of measured bicycle volumes to compute exposure-normalized risk at the street-segment level. Motivated by the empirical concentration of crashes at 
intersections, we also derived risk estimates for network junctions. Risk was estimated at monthly resolution and could be conditioned on contextual factors (e.g., time 
of day and weather) to capture temporal variability. We then aggregated segment- and junction-level risk to score arbitrary routes, enabling comparisons that trade off 
estimated crash risk against convenience criteria such as distance or travel time. The result is a reproducible framework for exposure-controlled, context-aware 
bicycle safety analysis and safety-informed routing on urban street networks.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Cycling safety analyses often rely on raw crash counts, which conflate danger with demand: streets that attract many cyclists tend to accumulate more incidents even 
when per-rider risk is low~\citep{luecken2018}. This obscures intrinsically risky locations and limits both targeted interventions and everyday route choice, 
especially in dense urban networks such as Berlin~\citep{Uijtdewilligen01092024}. We address this by estimating bicycle crash risk per unit of cyclist exposure on 
the street network and propagating these estimates to route-level scores suitable for navigation. Our study combines police-recorded crashes from the German 
\emph{Unfallatlas} (Berlin subset)~\citep{Unfallatlas2025} with a city-wide dataset of measured bicycle volumes at the street-segment level~\citep{kaiser_2025_15332147}. 
We compute exposure-normalized risk for individual street segments and, motivated by the concentration of crashes at intersections, derive junction-level risk by 
aggregating volumes from adjoining segments. Risk is estimated at monthly resolution and can be conditioned on contextual factors such as time of day and weather to 
capture temporal variability. We then aggregate segment- and junction-level risk to evaluate arbitrary routes and compare alternatives that reduce estimated risk 
while maintaining comparable convenience in terms of distance or travel time~\citep{isprs-archives-XLIII-B4-2022-427-2022}. Our work makes the following contributions: 
(i) a reproducible pipeline for exposure-normalized crash risk at segment and junction levels using measured volumes; (ii) a framework for context-conditional risk 
analysis; and (iii) a route-scoring procedure that integrates network-level risk into safety-aware routing under convenience constraints.

The paper is organized as follows: we review related work in Section~\ref{sec:relatedw}, describe the data and methods in Section~\ref{sec:data_and_methods}, present the 
results in Section~\ref{sec:results}, and discuss and conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relatedw}
To avoid conflating danger with demand, prior work normalizes bicycle crashes by cyclist exposure~\citep{luecken2018}. City-scale studies show that 
exposure-normalized risk yields more informative spatial patterns than raw counts and that finer temporal resolution improves inference, while noting persistent 
under-reporting in police records~\citep{Uijtdewilligen01092024}. A central challenge is obtaining reliable exposure: some approaches extrapolate city-wide volumes 
from sparse counters using learning-based models and multi-source features, with short measurement campaigns improving predictions at new locations~\citep{Kaiser_Klein_Kaack_2025}, 
whereas more recent efforts provide street-segment datasets of measured bicycle volumes, enabling downstream safety analyses without modeling exposure~\citep{kaiser2025spatiotemporalgraphneuralnetwork}. 
At the network level, studies define risk as crashes per unit exposure on links and address practical issues such as spatial snapping of crashes, allocating events 
near intersections, and integrating safety metrics into routing under convenience constraints~\citep{isprs-archives-XLIII-B4-2022-427-2022}. Intersection safety is 
critical: case analyses document strong crash concentrations at junctions and stress controlling for exposure when comparing infrastructure types or locations~\citep{futuretransp1030037}. 
Building on exposure-normalized analysis~\citep{Uijtdewilligen01092024}, the availability of measured volumes~\citep{Kaiser_Klein_Kaack_2025,kaiser2025spatiotemporalgraphneuralnetwork}, 
and advances in safety-aware routing~\citep{isprs-archives-XLIII-B4-2022-427-2022}, we estimate crash risk for Berlin at street-segment and junction levels using 
measured exposure, support context-conditional risk analysis, and propagate network-level risk to route-level scores.

\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:data_and_methods}
% In this section, describe \emph{what you did}. Roughly speaking, explain what data you worked with, how or from where it was collected, it's structure and size. Explain your analysis, and any specific choices you made in it. Depending on the nature of your project, you may focus more or less on certain aspects. If you collected data yourself, explain the collection process in detail. If you downloaded data from the net, show an exploratory analysis that builds intuition for the data, and shows that you know the data well. If you are doing a custom analysis, explain how it works and why it is the right choice. If you are using a standard tool, it may still help to briefly outline it. Cite relevant works. You can use the \verb|\citep| and \verb|\citet| commands for this purpose \citep{mackay2003information}.

\subsection{Data}\label{sec:data}
We combine police-recorded bicycle crashes with measured cyclist exposure for the city of Berlin. Crash data come from the Berlin subset of the German 
\emph{Unfallatlas}~\citep{Unfallatlas2025} filtered for bicycle-related incidents, and exposure is provided by a city-wide dataset of measured bicycle volumes 
aggregated at the street-segment level~\citep{kaiser2025spatiotemporalgraphneuralnetwork}. Together these sources enable exposure-normalized safety analysis at 
network scale. The street network is represented as polyline segments with associated monthly cyclist counts; crash locations are matched to segments via 
nearest-segment assignment in a projected coordinate system. To reflect the concentration of crashes at intersections, we identify junctions as nodes where at least 
three segments meet and assign crashes within a fixed radius to the nearest junction; junction exposure is the sum of the exposures of incident segments. All layers 
are harmonized to a common network topology and coordinate reference system to produce consistent monthly panels at the segment and junction levels. The resulting 
dataset spans 2019–2023 and covers 4{,}958 street segments and 2{,}924 junctions in Berlin. After spatial matching to the street network and exposure data, the 
analysis includes 33{,}181 bicycle crashes. At monthly resolution, crash events are sparse: in a typical month, fewer than 5\% of segments and about 3\% of junctions record at least one crash, while most have none. This sparsity motivates exposure-normalized risk estimation and constrained routing to assess safety–convenience trade-offs.

\paragraph{Preprocessing.}
We aggregate crashes and exposure to monthly resolution; segments (or months) with zero measured exposure are excluded for that period. Junctions are derived from network topology, and crashes within the junction radius are assigned accordingly. The outputs are monthly segment- and junction-level panels used in all subsequent analyses.


\subsection{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
\paragraph{Exposure-normalized risk.}
For each street segment $s$ and month $t$, let $A_{s,t}$ be the number of police-recorded bicycle crashes and $E_{s,t}$ the measured cyclist exposure. Segment risk is
\begin{equation}
r_{s,t}=\frac{A_{s,t}}{E_{s,t}},
\end{equation}
reported as accidents per 10{,}000 trips for interpretability; segments with $E_{s,t}=0$ in month $t$ are excluded for that month~\citep{AASHTO2010HSM}. To capture the empirical concentration of crashes near intersections, we also estimate junction risk. A junction is any node with degree $\ge 3$. Crashes within a fixed radius of a junction centroid are assigned to that junction, whose exposure aggregates incident segments:
\begin{equation}
E_{v,t}=\sum_{s\in\mathcal{I}(v)} E_{s,t}.
\end{equation}
Junction risk is defined analogously to segment risk and reported per 10{,}000 trips. We estimate risk at monthly resolution to separate temporal regimes and enable conditioning on context (e.g., time of day, weather).

\paragraph{Routing graph.}
For each month $t$, we build a graph $G_t=(V_t,E_t)$ from the street network: nodes are segment endpoints, edges are segments with length $\ell_e$ and risk $r_{e,t}$. Junction identifiers and risks are mapped to nodes via spatial snapping in a projected coordinate system, yielding a month-specific, risk-annotated network.

\paragraph{Safety-aware routing.}
We compare shortest-distance routes with alternatives that reduce estimated risk under a distance constraint. Each edge $e=(u,v)$ has cost
\begin{equation}
c_e=\alpha\,\ell_e+\beta\,r_{e,t}+\gamma\,\frac{r_{u,t}+r_{v,t}}{2},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ weight distance, segment risk, and junction risk (nodes without junction risk contribute zero). Given an origin–destination pair, the baseline $P_{\text{dist}}$ minimizes length. A safety-aware route solves
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
P_{\text{safe}}=\arg\min_{P}\ & \sum_{e\in P} r_{e,t} \\
\text{s.t.}\ & L(P)\le (1+\varepsilon)\,L(P_{\text{dist}}),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with tolerance $\varepsilon$~\citep{ehrgott2005multicriteria}. We approximate this via a Lagrangian relaxation by minimizing a weighted combination of risk and length over a grid of trade-off parameters. Routing is performed independently by month, and results are pooled over many origin–destination pairs.

\paragraph{Evaluation metrics.}
For each pair, we report the relative length increase
\begin{equation}
\Delta_L=\frac{L(P_{\text{safe}})-L(P_{\text{dist}})}{L(P_{\text{dist}})}
\end{equation}
and the relative risk reduction
\begin{equation}
\Delta_R=\frac{R(P_{\text{dist}})-R(P_{\text{safe}})}{R(P_{\text{dist}})},
\end{equation}
where $R(P)=\sum_{e\in P} r_{e,t}$ is the sum of segment risks along route $P$. Pairs with $R(P_{\text{dist}})=0$ are excluded from $\Delta_R$. These metrics quantify how small detours trade distance for reductions in empirically observed crash risk.
