# data_literacy
## Project Structure & Conventions

This project follows a clear separation between **notebooks** and **core code** to ensure stability, readability, and scalability.

### Directory Structure
- `data/`  
  Raw and processed datasets.  
  Processed data and intermediate results should be persisted (e.g. Parquet).

- `notebooks/`  
  Used for exploration, analysis, and result presentation.  
  Notebooks should be lightweight, task-focused, and executable top-to-bottom.

- `output/`  
  files generated by notebooks such as maps

- `report/`  
  everything about the final report  

- `src/`  
  Contains all reusable project logic:
  - data loading and preprocessing  
  - feature engineering  
  - shared utilities  

### Conventions

- Notebooks must not contain core business logic; all reusable code lives in `src/`.
- Avoid large or monolithic notebooks; split work into small, task-oriented notebooks.
- Parameterize experiments via config files instead of hardcoding values.
- Every notebook must run via **Restart & Run All** without manual steps.
- Persist intermediate results to reduce memory usage and kernel instability.
- Use consistent naming 

> Notebooks are used to **tell the story** — the actual implementation lives in Python modules.
